Web Scraping: Fetch and extract text from the web pages.
Text Preprocessing: Clean and standardize the text (lowercase, remove punctuation, tokenize, remove stopwords, and lemmatize).
Sentiment Analysis: Calculate positive and negative word counts, and derive sentiment scores (Polarity and Subjectivity).
Readability Metrics: Measure average sentence length, percentage of complex words, fog index, syllables per word, and average word length.

Output: A CSV file with metrics including positive/negative scores, polarity, subjectivity, average sentence length, and other readability measures.
